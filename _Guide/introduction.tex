\section{Introduction} \label{intro}
This document will serve as a quick start guide for the SimComp project. First, you should learn how to download (\ref{nedlasting}), update (\ref{oppdatere}) and build (\ref{bygge}) the project. As you will discover in these sections, all source code and binaries are available at \href{https://github.com/LasseNatvig/SimComp}{Github}. Already compiled versions (executable files) of the console and the graphical user interface can be found under \href{https://github.com/LasseNatvig/SimComp/releases/tag/v1.0}{realeases}. A short guide on how to use the applications is found in the \href{https://github.com/LasseNatvig/SimComp/wiki}{wiki}.
