\section{Contributing}
Everyone are welcome to contribute, but since this is a project made for students taking the \href{https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4102}{TDT4102} NTNU course, their pull requests and issues will be prioritized. A detailed description on how to contribute will follow below.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, you'll need to fork the \href{https://github.com/LasseNatvig/SimComp}{\textit{Github}} repository by click on the "Fork"-button.

        \label{fig:fork}
    \end{figure}
    This will create version of the project on your \textit{Github}-account. 
    \item Next, follow section \ref{nedlasting} but replace the url in step 4 (3 on Linux/mac) with your own: \texttt{https://github.com/<YOURUSERNAME>/SimCom.git}. This will give you a local clone of your fork.
    \item Make changes to your version. Remember to push the changes to the remote (Github).
    \item Create a new pull request by click the "New pull request"-button in your fork.

    \item Now, make sure that you intend to make the changes listed. When you are sure, follow these steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Choose the branch that you want to make the changes to (Probably master).
        \item Choose the branch (on your fork) that you made the changes on. 
        \item Create the pull request by clicking "Create pull request".
